## 🚀 Getting Started - Dive Right In!

Ready to experience PeerStream locally? Follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites 🛠️

Make sure you have Node.js and a package manager (npm, yarn, or pnpm) installed on your machine.

*   **Node.js:** [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
*   **npm:**  Usually comes bundled with Node.js.
*   **Yarn:**  `npm install -g yarn`
*   **pnpm:** `npm install -g pnpm`

### Installation ⚙️

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nasserml/peer-stream-omegle-clone-mearn-full-stack.git
    cd peer-stream-omegle-clone-mearn-full-stack-main/frontend
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install  # or yarn install or pnpm install
    ```

### Running the Development Server 💻

Fire up the development server and see the magic happen!

```bash
npm run dev   # or yarn dev or pnpm dev
```

This will start the Vite development server, and you can access the application in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:5173`.

## ⚙️ Configuration - Tweaking the Gears

Let's understand the purpose of some key configuration files:

*   **`eslint.config.js`:**  Defines the linting rules and plugins used to maintain code quality and consistency. It includes configurations for standard JavaScript, TypeScript, React Hooks, and React Refresh for hot module replacement. ✍️
*   **`postcss.config.js`:** Configures PostCSS, a tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins. It's used here to integrate Tailwind CSS and Autoprefixer. 💅
*   **`tailwind.config.js`:**  Customizes the Tailwind CSS framework, allowing you to define your design tokens, themes, and more. 🎨
*   **`tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.app.json`, `tsconfig.node.json`:**  These files configure the TypeScript compiler, specifying options like target ECMAScript version, module system, and strictness. They help ensure type safety and improve the development experience. 🛡️
*   **`vite.config.ts`:**  The configuration file for Vite, the build tool. It specifies plugins (like `@vitejs/plugin-react`) and other build-related settings. 🛠️

## 📜 Scripts - Your Command Center

Check out the `scripts` section in `package.json` for useful commands:

*   **`dev`:**  Starts the Vite development server with hot module replacement. 🔥
*   **`build`:**  Builds the production-ready application. 📦
*   **`lint`:**  Runs ESLint to check for code quality issues. 🔍
*   **`preview`:**  Serves the production build locally for testing. 👀
